# IntroductionToRobotics (2023-2024)

This repository will contain my work for the "Introduction to Robotics" course taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework will include requirements, code, photos, videos and details about the implementation.

## Homework 1
Task given by teacher: "Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins"

Only one .ino file was necessary to implement the task, found in the folder "Homework 1".
